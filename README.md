# PYTHON EXERCISES AND PRACTICE PROBLEMS

## DESCRIPTION:


__This a repository for my Exercises and Practice Problems in Python__

## Exercise1_MyDictionary:
we have to create a dictionary, similar to the real-world dictionary.

The details and functionalities that are essential and must be present are:

User will give a word as an input. Suppose that the word is present in your dictionary along with its definition or meaning.
The program will print the meaning or definition of that word.
For example:
The user inputs the word : “programming”

The output will be:

 "the process of writing computer programs"

The above one was just an example.

One word outputs are preferred.

The program should take operator and the two numbers as input from the user and then return the result

## Exercise3_GuessTheNumber
A "Number Guessing Game," in which a winning number is set to some integer value.
