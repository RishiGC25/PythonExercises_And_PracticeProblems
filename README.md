# PYTHON EXERCISES AND PRACTICE PROBLEMS

## DESCRIPTION:


__This a repository for my Exercises and Practice Problems in Python__

## Exercise1_MyDictionary:
we have to create a dictionary, similar to the real-world dictionary.

User will give a word as an input. Suppose that the word is present in your dictionary along with its meaning.
The program will print the meaning or definition of that word.
For example:
The user inputs the word : “coding”

The output will be:

 "Using the programming language to get the computer to behave as desired."

The above one was just an example...
One word outputs are preferred.


## Exercise2_FaultyCalculator
Exercise 2 - Faulty Calculator
Design a calculator which will correctly solve all the problems except
the following ones:
45 * 3 = 555, 56+9 = 77, 56/6 = 4
The program should take operator and the two numbers as input from the user and then return the result


## Exercise3_GuessTheNumber
A "Number Guessing Game," in which a winning number is set to some integer value. 
The Program should take input from the user, and if the entered number is less than the winning number, a message should display that the number is smaller and the appropriate message if it is larger.

  
## Exercise4_PatternPrinting
Pattern Printing  
Input = Integer n 
  
True: Prints an star pattern arrangement with of n lines

False: Prints an inverted star pattern arrangement of n lines


## Exercise5_HealthManagementSystem
The task is to create a "Health Management System." Suppose you are a fitness trainer and nutritionist. You have to deal with three clients, i.e., (Harry, Rohan, Hammad). For each client, you have to design their exercise and diet plan.

Instructions:
Create a food log file and an exercise log file for each client.
Ask the user whether they want to log or retrieve client data.
Write a function that takes the user input of the client's name. After the client's name is entered, it will display a
message as "What you want to log- Diet or Exercise?".

Use function
def getdate():
           import datetime
           return datetime.datetime.now()
The purpose of this function is to give time with every record of food or exercise added in the file.
Write a function to retrieve exercise or food file records for any client.


## Exercise6_Game_StonePaperScissors  
This is a stone-paper-scissiors game against the CPU(maybe even A.I. that analyses your every move with some secret algorithm and will ultimately defeat you! ;) ).  
It has a scoreboard which gets updated with each iteration/chance.  

Rules of the game:  

Stone X Scissors -- Stone   Wins  
Stone X Paper    -- Paper   Wins  
Paper X Scissors -- Scissor Wins
